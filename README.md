What was done: Multi UV Shader implementation into Unity 6





**Reflection**



When following the slides to program the shader I started to get used to how it would function. The comments that were in the example code helped me to understand what each section of the code was modifying in the shader. I ran into the same problem that many other people had which was some of the symbols/cases in the code not showing up well on the slides themselves (most notably the underscores \_ ). The more I continue to type out the code for the shaders, the more I slowly understand how they function. I think it will still take some time before I can really grasp it so for now I should continue to practice.
